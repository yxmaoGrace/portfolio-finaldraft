            all of which have given me many body and emotional energies, 
            and created many precious memories with my family and friends.</p>

		<h2>Hand-stretched Lanzhou Beef Noodle Soup</h2> 
        <p>As the most famous dish from my hometown, Lanzhou Beef Noodle Soup is 
            the most popular brunch choice for people in Lanzhou. 
            Many of my mornings start with a hot bowl of beef noodle soup with red chili oils on top.
            A nice bowl of Lanzhou beef noodle soup consists of six essential elements:
            Clear, aromatic beef broth;
            Cubes/slices of cooked beef;
            Melt-in-your-mouth daikon slices (aka mooli/Chinese white radish);
            Elastic hand-pulled noodles;
            Generous amount of chilli oil;
            Fresh coriander or green garlic to garnish
            Fun fact: there is a restaurant near central campus here at Ann Arbor, 
            named Lan City Noodles, featuring this noodle soup from my hometown. 
            However, it does not taste at all like the authentic one.</p>

      <div class="hotPot text" tabindex="0">
        <h2>Hot-pot</h2>
            <P>I have not spent one winter without a hot pot so far, 
            because sitting around a boiling hot pot with friends and family 
            during cold winter is so great. Another great thing about hot pot 
            is the freedom of choosing among hundreds of meet, vegetables, 
            and carbs to be put in the pot. Even though some food takes time 
            to be ready to serve, the waiting is always worthwhile.</P>

      <div class="lamb text" tabindex="0">
        <h2>Barbecued lamb skewers</h2>
        <P>Barbecued lamb skewers are the number one choice of late night snack 
            during summer nights in my hometown, Lanzhou. Imagine drinking beers 
            and chatting with friends while sitting by the street eating these spicy lamb skewers.</P>

      <div class="stirFry text" tabindex="0">
        <h2>Hunan Pork Stir Fry</h2>
        <P>There was a small Hunan dish restaurant close to my home, so my parents 
            and I went a lot to eat dinner there. We order Hunan pork stir fry every time, 
            because it is so great when eaten together with rice. Many of my great 
            family dinner memories include this dish, so I still seek to order it from 
            Chinese restaurants from time to time even now in the United States.</P>

        <img src = "images/luosifen.jpg" alt = "A bowl of Luosifen" width="200"/> 
      </div>

      <div class="luosifen text" tabindex="0">     
        <h2>Luosifen</h2>
        <P>A specialty from Liuzhou, Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region, luosifen is boiled with 
            rice noodles, pickled bamboo shoots, dried turnips, fresh vegetables and peanuts 
            in a spiced river snail soup. It used to be a cheap street snack for locals in Liuzhou, 
            but people from outside the city were not so familiar with it. However, the dish is now an “internet star” across China, 
            and also popular among overseas Chinese. With its special “smelly” flavor coming with the pickled bamboo shoots, 
            Luosifen’s soup is nonetheless tasty and spicy. Eating the slippery rice noodles soaked in the hot soup is 
            my favorite comfort food during my final weeks.</P>
