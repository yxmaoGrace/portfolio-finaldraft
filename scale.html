		<h2>What Is The Scoville Scale?</h2>
		<p>In 1912 American pharmacist Wilbur Scoville devised a test to determine the heat level of 
			different chilies. Originally called the Scoville Organoleptic Test, it was a scientific method 
			of testing the pungency (heat) of a pepper. At least it was as scientific as it could get considering 
			that it was still based on how humans detect spiciness.</p>

		<h2>How Does The Scoville Scale Work?</h2>
		<p>Alcohol is used to extract the capsaicinoids from dried peppers. Then sugar water 
			is used to dilute the capsaicinoids incrementally and given to a panel of testers. 
			When the testers no longer discern heat the test is done.</p>

		<h2>What is the Scoville scale based on?</h2>
		<p>Human taste buds. The heat level or Scoville heat unit of the pepper is based on 
			the amount of dilution it took for the majority of the human testers to no longer 
			detect the heat. For example, if a pepper has a SHU (Scoville Heat Unit) of 100, 
			that means the capsaicinoids had to be diluted 100 times for testers not to detect spiciness. 
			This creates the pepper hotness scale.</p>

		<h2>What Is The Shortcoming Of The Scoville Scale?</h2>
		<p>As I already explained, there are some shortcomings with the Scoville heat scale, 
			like human taste buds. Even though testers go through training, not all taste buds taste the same. 
			In some cases, results can vary up to 50%.
			There is a more scientific, no humans required, test called High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) 
			that measures in Asta Pungency Units. If youâ€™re interested in this other method of testing be 
			on the lookout for the article.</p>
